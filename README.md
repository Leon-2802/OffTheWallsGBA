# Off The Walls GBA Edition

### Description
This project is a "port" to the Gameboy Advance of my first real Unity game-project [OffTheWalls](https://github.com/Leon-2802/Off-the-Walls), which I developed in 2021.
The original Unity project was never deployed, but it is in a perfectly playable state inside the Unity Editor.
The aim of the project is to learn to develope software on a low level, close to the hardware with the C programming language, which is rather new for me at this point.
Porting one of my first game projects to the GBA serves as a little extra motivation in this case, it is not the main goal of the project.
